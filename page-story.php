        <p>
          We are an IT company that develops FruEats. <br>
          We have a lot of desk work, so coffee and snacks are refreshing,<br>
          I wanted to be healthy, but I didn't want to hold back on snacks. <br>
          <br>
          So I wondered if I could develop a healthy but delicious snack<br>
          We repeatedly conducted market research and user surveys. <br>
          Then I found out that more people than I expected had the same idea,<br>
          The development of "Snacks that you don't have to put up with" has started.

              <h3>Focused on dietary fiber</h3>
              <p>From the results of the questionnaire survey, we found that surprisingly many people are conscious of
                "dietary fiber" rather than protein and vitamins. <br>
                <br>
                However, when we investigated the actual situation, most Japanese people did not meet the recommended
                amount of dietary fiber intake per day. <br>
                <br>
                In other words, it is difficult to ingest dietary fiber in a normal diet. <br>
                <br>
                We have repeatedly considered snacks that anyone can easily add dietary fiber, and "FruEats", which
                allows you to take in dietary fiber for half a day with just 3 cookies, was born.

              <h3>Plant-derived simple<br>
                Made with only materials</h3>

              <p>So that everyone can have a pleasant snack time, we have realized deliciousness with only simple
                plant-derived ingredients. <br>
                <br>
                We do not use animal ingredients such as flour, eggs, butter, etc., which are often used in cookie
                ingredients, so that vegans and people with gluten allergies can eat them. <br>
                Also, no artificial sweeteners or preservatives are used.

        <h2>To achieve both health and taste</h2>
        <p>
          In order to achieve both health and deliciousness, it is extremely difficult to make delicious food without
          using the ingredients that are normally used by adding plenty of dietary fiber. Supervised by a chef who has
          won a world championship, "FruEats" was completed after dozens of prototypes. </p>

            In order to combine 10g of dietary fiber with 3 pieces, okara and oatmeal are used instead of wheat flour
            and rice flour. It has a crunchy texture with a unique combination and baking method. Please enjoy new
            sweets that are not only delicious, but can be eaten every day to add dietary fiber. </p>

        <p>Due to the recent westernization of Japanese diet, the intake of dietary fiber continues to decline. By
          ingesting dietary fiber, you can expect happy effects such as improving the intestinal environment, making
          your skin cleaner, and leading to a diet.
          Also, chewing more often increases satisfaction and helps prevent overeating. <br>
          <br>
          It may be difficult for people who are busy to get all the dietary fiber they need in a day with vegetables,
          but 3 servings of fruit can provide 1/2 of the dietary fiber they need in a day. .
          In addition, there are two types of dietary fiber, soluble and insoluble, and each has different functions, so
          it is recommended that you take them in a well-balanced manner. It is also recommended that you can take
          fiber. <br>
          <br>
          The characteristics of fruit oats are that instead of wheat flour, okara powder and oatmeal, which are rich in
          dietary fiber, are used. Nutrients that are usually lacking can be taken deliciously with full oats.
          In addition, it does not use wheat flour, eggs, or dairy products, so it can be enjoyed by people with wheat
          allergies, egg allergies, and dairy product allergies.
          Full Oats is a delicious cookie that I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to take in dietary fiber
          easily.
